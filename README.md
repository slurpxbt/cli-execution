# cli execution
todo:

linear running: 
- create bat file that runs cli_linear.py
- input credentials into credentials.json

multithreaded running:
- create bat file that runs cli_multithreaded.py
- input credentials into credentials.json
- create 2 discord chanels(1 for bybit and 1 for binance), create webhooks and put them into webhook_config.json

PROS of linear: 
- a bit more bulletproff

PROS of multithreaded:
- u can run multitple order executions on multiple exchange at once
- u can edit position tp/sl while position is still opening etc
- gives order execution notifications to discord

disclaimer: u should now a bit of coding to run this since it's not bulletprof and not all possible errors are handled, start with linear and when u know how to use it go to multithreaded version
